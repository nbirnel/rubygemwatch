rubygemwatch
---------

See how often versions of a ruby gem are being downloaded from rubygems.org

Installation
---------

The github page is for development.
To install, do:
  
  $ gem install rubygemwatch

Inspiration and History
---------

Seeing my first trivial ruby gem downloaded 153 times in 12 hours made me 
curious.

Gems <https://github.com/rubygems/gems> could do this too, but 782 SLOC seemed
excessive to me for what I wanted to do.
